This cost-efficient MVP environment, ready in just a few clicks, could include: **WordPress + WooCommerce + WooCommerce Subscriptions + essential plugins** (PeteSync, PixelYourSite for ad tracking, and more) **+ Laravel**. This stack lets you create landing pages, process payments and subscriptions, track ads, and use unlimited WordPress pluginsâ€”while extending a shared logged-in environment with Laravel.
